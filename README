This is the readme file for bio_lib.pl subroutine library.

(L) CopyLEFT notice.

bio_lib.pl is a file which contains various subroutines 
made by jong and others. It is free, freely copiable, modifiable,
distributable, claimable that you wrote them after you change
one single line(all codes originated by jong other codes given
by others will bear copyright notice if they have instructed me
to do so). 

I mean it is a real public like oxygen, I would not claim a puff
of air is mine as it has been though my body and brain, and went 
through chemical reaction in my blood. As far as I am concerned
accumulated knowledge of humans is like air. 

It is not a registered or publically announced perl module for
standard coding for Biologists and Computer scientists
in Bioinformatics field. It is just a lib where you may
fish something useful as that was what I did for long from
others. When I organize these subs later or any people can
formulate a good standard for object oriented Bioperl module, I
will change these into the more standard form if it really
helps more people reuse perl routines developed in your
field.

Comments and your codes to  jong@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk

I will continuously collect any subroutines you send me to
this.
