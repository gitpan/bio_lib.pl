Bio.pl is a personal library with various utilities for

	Biological sequence analysis. It also contains a lot of
	utilies for file, array, hash etc. Subroutines are very
	general and you can easily copy them to your own perl
	codes.

	To use, you can search for keywords to get some useful
	subroutines.


	Version: 1.3

# Title     : Bio
# Usage     : require "Bio.pl"; ##<-- This is very slow, so you'd better
#             copy the subroutines in your prog. or make a smaller lib files
#               which are classified according to functions(like, Bio_Seq.pl
#               for sequence handling, Bio_Array.pl for various array
#               subroutines..), or make your own module out of this, do whatever
#               you want....
# Function  : This has all the sub routines A Biomatic has developed.
#             You can copy any of the sub routines in this file, modify, use
#             in yours...
#             Use Bio.pm if you want to use bio_lib.pl as a module and want
#             to call its subroutines by 'use Bio' in your code.
#             PLEASE MODIFY AS FREELY AS YOU WANT !!
#
#             " I am the programmer and I will try to debug with all my
#             efforts if you have any problems with my codes."
#
#             All my subroutines are tested in small files which test
#             the subroutines. If you want to have such single example program
#             to see how they really work, pls contact me( A Biomatic )
#             For example, a file called  'handle_arguments.pl' exists to
#             test the subroutine 'handle_arguments'.
#
#             for Bioperl project(the open project anybody can participate in)
#             The newest version of B.pl is in:
#             ftp://ftp.mrc-cpe.cam.ac.uk/pub/jong/Bioperl
#
# Example   : require "Bio.pl";
# Warning   : CopyLEFTed, and for the enhancement of Biology and Science.
#             This is a development companion, nothing else.
# Class     : Bio
#             Class is for classification of my subroutines. If it is B, it can
#             be useful for biological sequence data handling. If it's Utility,
#             it can also be used for general purpose file handling stuff.
#             File, Array, Hash,... are my classification items.
# Keywords  : Biology, sequence handling,
# Options   : nothing (used as subroutine library)
# Reference : http://sonja.acad.cai.cam.ac.uk/perl_for_bio.html
# Returns   : nothing (used as subroutine library)
# Tips      :
# Argument  : nothing (used as subroutine library)
# Todo      : Objects out of this.
# Author    : A Biomatic  and many others. Send me your codes to me!
